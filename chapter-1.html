      The Mahabharata was first spoken not in a palace but in a forest,
      where the sage Vyasa revealed a story so vast that it contained all human life.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “What is found here may be found elsewhere.  
      What is not found here is nowhere at all.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
          In a forest hermitage, a wandering bard recited an immense tale of kings and kin to a circle of attentive sages, calling it the story of the Bharatas and the great war that would end an age.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sages, struck by the scope of the narrative, asked how a single mortal could gather such a complete account of births, vows, pilgrimages, battles, and the subtle turns of fate woven through it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, the bard spoke of the seer Vyasa, born of the island-born sage and the river, whose vision ranged over past, present, and futures yet unopened.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          The epic, he said, was not merely a story of princes and weapons, but a mirror in which duty, desire, and consequence stand side by side.
          <footer>Retelling inspired by the opening dialogues of Adi Parva.</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Vyasa, seeking to set this mirror into verse, is said to have sought a scribe worthy of its burden; the deity of wisdom agreed to inscribe it, on the condition that the poet let no pause fall in his composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          To match this condition, the seer composed verses rich in layered meaning, buying time in their depths while the scribe considered each line before carving it into memory.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <p>
          Thus the Mahabharata came to be spoken and written as both story and scripture, a gathering place for legends older than the war itself and teachings that point past the fall of kingdoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the bard finished his explanation, the sages invited him to recite the epic in full, beginning with the births of the house whose choices would send chariots to the field of Kurukshetra.
