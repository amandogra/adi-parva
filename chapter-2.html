     <p>
          Before the princes of the great war were born, the line of the Bharatas stretched back through kings who wrestled with promises, rituals, and the fragile work of holding a realm together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among them shone King Shantanu of the Kuru line, whose river-bound marriage first, and later forest-bound love, would each send ripples down the generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          From his union with the river goddess came a son, Devavrata, trained in arms and scripture, whose strength and clarity of mind made him the natural heir to the throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years later, Shantanu met a fisher-chief's daughter whose father demanded that only a son born to her should inherit, a condition that threatened Devavrata's succession and the king's happiness alike.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          To protect his father's joy and the line of the Bharatas, Devavrata vowed to renounce both the throne and marriage, accepting a life of celibacy so that no child of his could ever claim the crown.
          <footer>This terrible vow would earn him the name Bhishma, “he of the fearsome oath”.</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The heavens trembled at the severity of the vow, and the throne was secured for the yet-unborn child of the fisher-maiden, while Bhishma took upon himself the duty of guarding the kingdom.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <p>
          In time, two princes were born to Shantanu and his queen: Chitrangada and Vichitravirya, whose brief lives and untimely deaths would leave the royal line dangerously thin.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is into this narrowing branch of the Bharata tree that the next generation must arrive, through choices and arrangements that test the limits of custom and sacrifice.
