          When both Chitrangada and Vichitravirya died without heirs, Bhishma stood bound by his oath, unable to take the throne or beget sons to continue the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          The widowed queens of Vichitravirya, Ambika and Ambalika, remained in the palace, their fates tied to a kingdom without an obvious successor.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this turning, the queen-mother Satyavati called upon her son Vyasa, asking him to raise up children in the royal line through the ancient practice of niyoga, in which a wise man fathers heirs on behalf of the dead.

          From these tense and uneasy unions were born three princes: Dhritarashtra, blind from birth; Pandu, pale and gifted in arms; and Vidura, whose wisdom would become the conscience of the court.
        </p>

          Calling first on the god of righteousness, she received Yudhishthira; then the lord of storms, bringing forth Bhima; then the radiant Indra, who granted Arjuna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, her co‑wife Madri invoked the twin Ashvins and bore the younger brothers Nakula and Sahadeva, completing the five who would be known as the Pandavas.
